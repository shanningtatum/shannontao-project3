My third project during my Immersive Web Development Bootcamp course at Juno College of Technology.

This app was created using React JS, CSS, and Google's Firebase.

It is an UberEats bill splitter where users can enter the number of people they want to split the bill with, enter each person's order and cost of their meal, input the additional bill details, and it will tell them how much each person owes them.
